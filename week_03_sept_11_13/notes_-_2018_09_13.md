# Notes for September 13, 2018

General Announcements:
* Important notes on labs:
    * I'm finally in Moodle. I'm not set up as a teacher yet, but should be later today.
    * You can skip questions in the lab. If you are stuck, try completing the later questions and go back.
    * You can download the completed lab. If your partner submits then download their lab so you can study it.
    * In tomorrow's lab you might see something about pass-by-value regarding passing a parameter to a function. Pass the variable normally. We'll get into the nomenclature later. 
    * You do not need to understand while loops or lists for this lab. It just covers functions, and uses basic math and string manipulation (joining strings).
    * Bring your iClicker to lab. 
* Quizes will allow for multiple submissions, just like the labs.
* No partners for quizes.
* Topics covered in today's notebooks
    * Starer code -- while loop and function Design Recipe
    * Using mod (remainder) 
    * Design Recipe for functions
        * Review function definition and comment blocks

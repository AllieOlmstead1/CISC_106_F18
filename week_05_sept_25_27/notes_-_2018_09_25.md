# Notes for September 25, 2018

General Announcements:
* Second quiz is live, due end of day Thursday, just like the latest lab.
* I like all the questions on this quiz, so you may see something similar on the test.
 * Exception: I'm not testing on the exponentiation (power of) operator (i.e. 3**2 == 9)
* We will go over what will be on the test more in depth on Thursday. I'll give a list of all the native functions you should know off hand (type(), int(), etc). 
* For the first test you do not need to memorize method names, but you should be familiar with any we have used in class. I will provide the method you need to use in the problem description (i.e. use the string lower() method to yada yada).

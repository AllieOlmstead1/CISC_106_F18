Click the binder link above to open this repository in an online notebook. (Right click to open in a new tab or window)

If you miss a class, or want to review, open the notebook shared in that class and select menu item "Kernel => Restart & Clear Output." Then step through each notebook cell. (Hint: Shift + Enter is a keyboard shortcut to execute a cell and move to the next cell.)

Use the scratchpad notebook to run test code as you work through problems. If you install Python on your own machine you can open a Python shell window instead.

This repository will contain materials that were used, discussed, or created in class. Each class will include a file of notes creatd in Markdown, and one or more notebooks.

You do not need to create an account on GitHub, but you should.

This repository will be more useful if you run the code in your own notebooks. Options:
* [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org)
  * Pros
    * Fast and easy -- Just click the Binder badge above
    * This will always have the lastest notebooks that I have posted for you to use
  * Cons
    * This will not save your changes. You can play around with it, but your changes will be lost
    * It times out pretty quickly when not in use, and you'll need to relaunch
* [Microsoft Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com/)
  * Pros
    * You can pull my repository fron GitHub to run here
    * You can also create your own and save code samples
    * No need to download and install anything
  * Cons
    * Microsoft does not accept your udel.edu email for account creation, you will need to use a different email to create an account
    * Pulling the latest notebooks from GitHub is not trivial, though you can always delete and reimport from your library
  * Notes:
    * Everything is based on a "library," import my GitHub repository from there
* [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com) -- Download and run notebooks on your own machine
  * Pros
    * Brag to your friends that you installed Python on your own computer.
  * Cons
    * This is by far the hardest option, but also the most rewarding once you are done. 
    * There is no offical support from teachers or TAs for this option. There are plenty of guides online, and you can ask fellow students for help.
  * Guides:
    * [Offical install guide](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/)
    * [Getting started guide from the CodingTheSmartWay.com Blog](https://medium.com/codingthesmartway-com-blog/getting-started-with-jupyter-notebook-for-python-4e7082bd5d46)

A hybrid approach is probably best. You can always quickly run my latest code by clicking the Binder badge, and either use Azure or your own Anaconda instance to create and store notebooks that you created to reference in the future.
